# Introduction 
#### I started this project to practice and brush up on skills in Python and relevant libraries required for Data Analysis while also learning some new skills. I have noticed that the ability to  leverage Python is important and companies everyday are requiring their data analysts to learn how to utilize this powerful tool. So I created this repository to showcase my core Python Skills for employers. For my first project, I recreated a project that was done by Luke Barousse who is a Youtuber that posts valuable info and tutorials on data analytics. I have linked the video I used for this project along with Luke's github below!

# Analysis 
#### Finding the most popular skills in job postings required some basic filtering of the dataframe followed by exploding the job skills list into individual rows. After adjusting the dataframe to what I needed I plotted the data into bar charts with each bar representing a different skill.

# Insights
#### In the image above you'll see the percentage chance that a skill will be required for a specific job. The plot shows that Python is a sought after skill and is typically one that Data Scientists and Data Engineers need to know. Data Analysts also need to know Python as well but it is not as common. Additionally SQL is typically a required skill in over 50% of job postings for Data Analysts and Data Scientists.
